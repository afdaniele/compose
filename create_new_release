This is a checklist for what to do before creating a new release:

[ ] - change the version in `doxygen_documentation_project`
    PROJECT_NUMBER         = X.Y

[ ] - copy the documentation from /data/showdown/vX.Y to /data/showdown/vX.Z
    where X.Y is the latest release and X.Z is the new release

[ ] - update the symlink in the documentation, from vX.Y to vX.Z

[ ] - change the destination of the MD files in Settings > Package: Doxygen Documentation to X.Z
    [ ] - Rebuild the documentation for the new release
