This is a checklist for what to do before creating a new release:
Assume we go X.Y -> X.Z

[ ] - change the version in `doxygen_documentation_project`
    PROJECT_NUMBER         = X.Y

[ ] - branch `vX.Z` out of `devel` in afdaniele/compose-docs

[ ] - add `vX.Z` as submodule in afdaniele/compose-docs that points to the `vX.Z` branch

[ ] - update the symlink `latest` in afdaniele/compose-docs to point to `vX.Z`

[ ] - change the destination of the MD files in Settings > Package: Doxygen Documentation to X.Z
    [ ] - Rebuild the documentation for the new release
