# Package Store

**\\compose\\** is built around the concept of installable packages.
Each feature you develop or use that does not come natively with **\\compose\\**,
is always part of an external package. In order to facilitate the management of these

The **Package Store** connects to a public registry of packages, and lets you
discover new ones to install, update those that are outdated, or removed old ones.
The Package Store page looks like the following,

## Develop your own package

you to develop new features by building your own package.

Check out the pages [Create new package](new-package), and [Create new page](new-page)
to learn more about how to develop new functionalities in **\\compose\\**.
